I'm a university student interested in backend development, software architecture, and practical coding projects. I like learning by building — from simple console tools to small web apps — and improving my code organization and version control skills.

* 🎓 **Student at FEL ČVUT** (software engineering)
* 💡 Learning **Python**, **C++**, **Java**, **PHP**, and **JavaScript**
* 🧠 Exploring clean architecture, MVC design, and Git workflows
* 🧩 I enjoy understanding how things work and making them better

## 📚 Current focus

* Learning **object-oriented programming** and **design principles**
* Writing cleaner and more maintainable code
* Understanding **Git branching** and version control in teams
* Experimenting with small web apps and refactoring exercises

## 🚀 Projects & ideas
> A small list of things I want to build or learn.

* 🏟️ **Sport Areal Website (PHP + HTML/CSS + JSON)** — website project with MVC structure and cleaner code organization
* 🧩 **Sorting Algorithm Visualization (Python)** — interactive project to visualize how sorting algorithms work
* 🌳 **Python Tree Algorithm Visualization (Python)** — Binary Search Tree visualizer: start with a root value; for each new number insert left if smaller, right if larger (optionally handle duplicates)
* 🗺️ **Graph Dijkstra Visualization (Python)** — visualize shortest paths on weighted graphs; add nodes/edges, step through relaxation, show priority queue state and highlight final path
* 🗺️ **Dijkstra on 2D Grid (Python)** — shortest paths on a square grid: set start/goal, draw obstacles
* 🎮 **C++ Tetris (C++)** — classic Tetris game

>I’ll keep adding more ideas as I learn.
